# Authenticating an application on ACA without changing codes

You don't need to change a single line of code to secure your application deployed on [Azure Container Apps (ACA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview)! Instead, your application is automatically protected by simply enabling the authentication feature, called called EasyAuth.

Let's see how you can do it with a few mouse clicks!

## Prerequisites

For this episode, we will be using the app deployed from the [previous episode](../ep02/README.md). Note that no code needs to be changed to add this authentication feature.

## Secure the app in a few clicks

The app is now deployed, but it's not secure. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and find the Resource Group you just deployed (e.g., rg-ep02). In this resource group, open the `Container Apps Environment`.

![select the Container Apps Environment](./images/container_app_env.png)

From there, select the Container App `eshoplite-store`.

From the left menu, select Authentication and click Add identity provider.

You can choose between multiple providers, but let's use Microsoft since it's deployed in Azure and you are already logged in.

![select Microsoft](./images/provider-select.png)

Once Microsoft is chosen, you will see many configuration options. Select the recommended Client secret expiration (e.g., 180 days).

You can keep all the other default settings. Click Add. After a few seconds, you should see a notification in the top right corner that the identity provider was added successfully.

Voila! Your app is now secure.

Next time you navigate to the app, you will be prompted to log in with your Microsoft account. Notice that your entire app is protected. No page is accessible without authentication.

The first time you log in, you will see a Permissions requested screen. Note that it is `eshoplite-store`, check the consent checkbox, and click Accept.

## Built-in Authentication on ACA

The built-in authentication feature of ACA is a simple and powerful way to secure your applications with minimal effort. Here are some key points to remember:

- You don't need to change the existing app code to add this authentication feature.
- This built-in authentication feature of ACA protects your entire application, not individual pages.

For more details about the built-in authentication feature of ACA, see [Authentication and authorization in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/authentication).

## Clean up the deployed resources

To clean up the resources, run the following command:

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```
