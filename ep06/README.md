# EP06: Cost Optimization for ACA

This episode is about cost optimization for Azure Container Apps. But before we dive into the fine tuning, it's important to understand what scenarios are best suited for Azure Container Apps, and understand how to cost is calculated. Than we can look at the cost optimization strategies, and how to monitor our Apps and stay informed about the costs.

## A service for each scenarios

When looking at [Azure Container Apps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/) in the section `About Azure Container Apps` there a page [Compare Container options in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/compare-options)


Going through all the different services where containers can be used we can learn that:

- Container Apps is 
  - Optimized to run general purpose containers, especially for applications that span many microservices deployed in containers.
  - Powered by Kubernetes and open-source technologies like Dapr, KEDA, and envoy.
  - Supports Kubernetes-style apps and microservices with features like service discovery and traffic splitting.
  - Enables event-driven application architectures by supporting scale based on traffic and pulling from event sources like queues, including scale to zero.
  - Supports running on demand, scheduled, and event-driven jobs.

- Container Apps is not/ doest not 
  - Doest not provide direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs. If you require access, you should use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). 
  - Is not the less "opinionated" choice when you need only one isolated container that doesn't required scaling, load balancing, nor certificates. In those cases Azure Container Instances (ACI) could be preferable.
  - When more ephemeral code or containers are needed, Azure Functions could be a better choice.

## Understanding the cost

Looking at those two pages we can understand better how the cost is calculated. 
- [Billing in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/billing)
- [Azure Container Apps Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-apps/)


### Consumption plan

By default, Azure Container Apps runs in the Consumption plan and there are of two types of charges:

- Resource consumption: The amount of resources allocated to your container app on a per-second basis, billed in vCPU-seconds and GiB-seconds.
- HTTP requests: The number of HTTP requests your container app receives.
  
The following resources are free during each calendar month, per subscription:

- The first 180,000 vCPU-seconds
- The first 360,000 GiB-seconds
- The first 2 million HTTP requests

The number os running replicas will also impact the cost. We will see how we can change this, but before we do it's important to mentione another plan.

### Dedicated plan

Billing for apps and jobs running in the Dedicated plan is based on workload profile instances, not by individual applications. 


## Getting Started

You can reuse the code and deployed solution from the previous episode (ep04 or ep05). If you deleted the resources, you can redeploy them solution using the following steps.

1. Getting the Repository Root

	To simplify the copy paste of the commands that sometimes required an absolute path, we will be using the variable `REPOSITORY_ROOT` to keep the path of the root folder where you cloned/ downloaded this repository. The command `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` returns that path.

	```bash
	# Bash/Zsh
	REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
	```

	```powershell
	# PowerShell
	$REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
	```

1. Move to the `ep06` directory.

    ```bash
    cd $REPOSITORY_ROOT/ep06
    ```

1. Initialize the Azure Developer CLI (azd) in the current directory.

    ```bash
    azd init
    ```

1. Provision and deploy the microservice apps to ACA.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

1. Open the browser and navigate to the deployed app to validate that it's working as expected.
   

## Change the MIN and MAX number of replicas


You can change the number of replicas and the scaling directly in the Azure portal, but doing so would be overrided each time you deploy using the AZD CLI or the CI/CD pipeline. A better way would be to modify the bicep file and redeploy the app.

Open the `infra/resources.bicep` file and look for the `scaleMinReplicas` and `scaleMaxReplicas` for each containers. 

1. Change the minimum values from 1 to 0. This will allow the container to scale to zero when there is no traffic. When the App is accessed again, the container will be started again. This will save cost when the app is not being used, it's a good strategy for development, testing environments, and even for production environments that are not used 24/7.
1. Change the maximum values to 1. This will limit the number of replicas to 1. This will save cost as it limits the number of replicas that can be started. This can be a good strategy for development or when the app doesn't need to scale.

```bicep
module eshopliteProducts 'br/public:avm/res/app/container-app:0.8.0' = {
  name: 'eshopliteProducts'
  params: {
    name: 'eshoplite-products'
    ingressTargetPort: 8080
    // scaleMinReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Change the number of Replicas below
    scaleMinReplicas: 0
    scaleMaxReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Change the number of Replicas above
    // scaleMaxReplicas: 10
```

```bicep
module eshopliteStore 'br/public:avm/res/app/container-app:0.8.0' = {
  name: 'eshopliteStore'
  params: {
    name: 'eshoplite-store'
    ingressTargetPort: 8080
    // scaleMinReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Change the number of Replicas below
    scaleMinReplicas: 0
    scaleMaxReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Change the number of Replicas above
    // scaleMaxReplicas: 10
```

```bicep
module eshopliteWeather 'br/public:avm/res/app/container-app:0.8.0' = {
  name: 'eshopliteWeather'
  params: {
    name: 'eshoplite-weather'
    ingressTargetPort: 8080
    // scaleMinReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ Change the number of Replicas below
    scaleMinReplicas: 0
    scaleMaxReplicas: 1
    // ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Change the number of Replicas above
    // scaleMaxReplicas: 10
```

1. Redeploy the app. If you are using the (ep05) CI/CD pipeline, you can push the changes to the repository and the pipeline will deploy the changes. If you are using the AZD CLI, you can run the following command.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```

1. You can visualize the number of replicas in the Azure portal. Go to the Azure Container Apps resource, and click on one of the Container App (ex: eshoplite-store). From the left menu, in the `Application` section, click on `Scale`, the to see the number of replicas.

There many other things you can do to optimize the cost, like using the dedicated plan, using the right size of the container, and using the right number of replicas and customs Scaling rules. Keep in mind to do those changes in the bicep file, so you can keep track of the changes and redeploy the app when needed.

## Monitoring the Cost

Optimizing the cost is not a one-time task, it's an ongoing process. It's a good idea to monitor your applications stay informed about the cost. There are may ways and level of details you can monitor the cost of resources in Azure. Let's create a budget for the Azure Container Apps resource we just deplyed.

1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Resource Group where the Azure Container Apps resource is deployed (ex: rg-ep06). From the left menu, expenad the `Cost Management` section and click on budgets.
   
1. Click the Add to create a new bugget. Fill the form and specify the date, period, and amount you want to set for the budget. You can also set alerts with diferent threshold (ex: 50%) to be notified by email when those are reached.

1. Click on `Create` to finalize the budget.


## Clean up the deployed resources

You can reuse this version for [EP07](../ep07/README.md). To clean up the resources, run the following command:

```bash
azd down --force --purge
```
