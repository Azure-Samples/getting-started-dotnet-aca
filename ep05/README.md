# EP05: Implementing CI/CD Pipeline for ACA

This sample demonstrates how to implement a Continous Integration/Continous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for Azure Container Apps (ACA) using Azure DevOps. We will create a GitHub action workflow to build and push the Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and deploy them to ACA. The code is based on the previous episode [EP04](../ep04/README.md).

## Prerequisites

To run this sample app, make sure you have all the [prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites).
